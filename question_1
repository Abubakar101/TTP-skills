// Question 1 -- sumOfTwo(a,b,v): You have two integer arrays, a and b, and an integer target value v.

// Determine whether there is a pair of numbers, where one number is taken from a and the other from b, that can be added together to get a sum of v.

// Return true if such a pair exists, otherwise return false.

const sumOfTwo = (a, b, v) => a + b === v;
sumOfTwo(2, 2, 4);
